                <img src="../images/bad_water.png" class="faq-imgv1" alt="bad water, ape no like">
                <p class="reuse-V1-ps1">Some of our top scientists have discovered through trial and error,
                    (our lawyers have advised us to not delve further) that coming into contact with irradiated water 
                    tests the body's natural ability to absorb and transform radiation into usable energy. 
                </p>
                <p class="reuse-V1-ps2">Irradiated water also holds the potential to boost cellular regeneration, 
                    increase resistance to other environmental toxins, and enhance physical stamina. 
                    Additionally, it can be seen as a means to strengthen mutant community bonds, with those who share these extraordinary adaptations, 
                    fostering a sense of unity and resilience. No relation to the Master's Unity.

                    For starters, we accept virtually any type of currency and/or payment. Due to fluctuating
                    currencies and the Brotherhood-Institute skirmishes, your currency value is pro-rated by our 
                    expert staff. We take Pre-War money (cash, in bulk), Gold Bullion, Gold Bars, bulk scrap or miner scrip 
                    for our Appalachian friends.

                    Whether you're a band of scavengers looking to bond over a shared thrill or a family 
                    unit seeking a memorable escape from the harsh realities of the wasteland, our group 
                    packages cater to parties of all sizes. For groups of five or more, we offer a 20% 
                    discount on our standard rates, ensuring everyone can experience the excitement 
                    without breaking the bank. Additionally, larger groups will have the added advantage 
                    of a discounted (20%) guide and exclusive access to our most secure rafts, providing an extra 
                    layer of safety and camaraderie.

                    Our rafts are constructed from the finest scraps scavenged and expertly
                    patched together with duct tape and determination. We pride ourselves on our innovative 
                    approach to safety; our life jackets, stitched from tire rubber and stuffed with 
                    dried mut-fruit, offer buoyancy and a bit of protection against the 
                    elements. Each raft is equipped with a mounted .50 cal, perfect for fending off any unexpected 
                    super mutants that may come your way.

                    Our guides are seasoned survivors, having navigated these treacherous waters countless times 
                    with only a few incidents. Each carries signal flares, first-aid supplies, freshly salvaged from Boston Medical, 
                    and a hardly Plasma Caster. We believe that part of the adventure is embracing the 
                    unknown, so while our safety measures may seem unconventional, they are tailored to the 
                    unique challenges of our Post-War world. At White Rad Rafting, we guarantee that your rafting experience 
                    will be as unforgettable as the apocalypse itself.
