    <p>I'm Jacob Emhoff, I love hiking and traveling with my family, but being a broke college student doesn't let me do that too much.</p>
    <p>So while I'm here I mostly play video/board games with my roommates, and I'm a big Star Wars and Fallout fan.</p>
    <p>I'm a Cloud Computing Major, and I'm well-versed in SQL, Python and C#. I also love the church, and I haven't served a mission yet, but I'm still thinking about it.  </p>
    <!--websites work with a 50% in the width size, and vs code aslo works with it?-->
